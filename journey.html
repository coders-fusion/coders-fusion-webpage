        <p>
          In our research endeavor, we embarked on a structured methodology
          referred to as the "Journey" to solidify and expand upon the findings
          available in the online domain. Our approach involved the distribution
          of a meticulously designed Google Form to a diverse audience,
          including both the general public and students of Multimedia
          University, representing various age groups and genders. Prior to
          commencing the questionnaire, we ensured that participants were
          equipped with a clear understanding of the concept of serious games,
          thus establishing a common foundation for the investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The questionnaire was systematically divided into five distinct
          segments, each tailored to explore specific facets of serious games
          across different domains. In the "Education Domain" section,
          participants were prompted to share their insights on how serious
          games can enhance learning within educational institutions.
          Additionally, they were asked to enumerate the serious games they had
          personally engaged with in the past year and articulate their
          perceptions regarding the primary obstacles to the adoption of serious
          games in education. The final inquiry sought to identify the serious
          game deemed most impactful in the educational sphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transitioning to the "Safety and Military Domain," respondents were
          queried about their firsthand experiences with serious games in the
          context of military training or simulations. They were also invited to
          reflect on the challenges associated with implementing serious games
          for safety and military applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the "Health Domain" segment, participants were encouraged to
          recount their encounters with serious games in health-related
          activities or training. Furthermore, they were invited to elucidate
          the predominant hurdles encountered in the development of
          health-focused serious games. The respondents were also requested to
          opine on the potential of certain serious games to enhance healthcare
          outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the "Business and Finance Domain," participants were asked to
          express their beliefs concerning the effectiveness of serious games in
          improving financial knowledge. They were further probed on their
          personal experiences with serious games in financial education or
          investments and their preferences for specific business and
          finance-related serious games.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "General Questions" section encompassed inquiries on participants'
          initial exposure to the concept of serious games, their domain
          preferences among those previously explored, and their evaluations of
          the efficacy of serious games in imparting complex concepts.
          Additionally, we sought to ascertain the motivating factors for
          individuals to explore new serious games and their perspectives on the
          benefits of engaging with serious games across various domains.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concluding questions centered on the willingness of respondents to
          participate in future serious game research studies or beta testing,
          thereby fostering potential avenues for ongoing collaboration and
          research in this dynamic field.
